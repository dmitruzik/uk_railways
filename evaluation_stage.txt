1. Changes from the Original Plan
The project evolved in a few ways during execution:
•	Focus Areas:
Initially, the plan emphasized a broad analysis of train ticket sales, delays, and cancellations. However, during the Development Stage, the focus shifted more specifically to:
•	The financial impact of delays and cancellations.Refund requests and customer dissatisfaction metrics.Causes of delays, particularly weather and operational factors.
This refinement allowed for deeper insights into the most critical areas, but some secondary aspects, like passenger demographics or specific station-level data, were not explored.
•	Additional Analysis:
While the original plan included investigating the revenue impact and reasons for delays, the analysis of ticket price disparities and the categorization of delay causes were added later to address emerging insights.
A few unexpected findings emerged during the analysis:
•	Higher Ticket Prices for Delayed and Canceled Journeys:
The average ticket price for these journeys (£55.33) was significantly higher than the overall average (£23.44). This suggests that premium services and longer journeys are disproportionately affected, which was not anticipated in the initial plan.
•	High Proportion of Weather-Related Delays:
Weather was responsible for 40.45% of delays, highlighting the vulnerability of the system to environmental factors. This discovery pointed to the need for infrastructure improvements and better weather forecasting integration.
•	Significant Refund Requests:
Around 23.8% of delayed or canceled journeys resulted in refund requests. This was higher than expected and underscored the financial and operational strain caused by delays. But almost 74% did not request a refund, which means that the company just kept that money.
3. Investigation Scope
While most of the objectives within the original plan were met, some areas remained unexplored due to time, data, or resource limitations:
•	Passenger Demographics:
Insights into which passenger groups (e.g., commuters vs. tourists) are most affected were not analyzed due to a lack of demographic data.
