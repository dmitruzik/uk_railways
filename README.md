Planning Stage:
Analyzing Train Journey Efficiency and Delay Patterns in the UK.
Problem Statement:
The problem being addressed is the inefficiency and frequent delays of train journeys in the UK, specifically focusing on data from the London train station. These delays can significantly impact commuters and the wider economy. Despite the critical role of rail networks in providing an environmentally friendly mode of transportation and connecting major cities, the reliability of train services has been a longstanding issue. Delays disrupt schedules, affect commuter trust, and often result in a ripple effect on other services.
Evidence of the Problem:
1.	Rising Delays and Customer Complaints: According to a report by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), train delays have steadily increased over recent years, with less than 65% of trains arriving on time in some areas. Quote: orr.gov.uk
2.	Economic Costs of Delays: A study by the Campaign for Better Transport highlighted that train delays cost the UK economy approximately £1 billion annually in lost productivity. Commuters who rely on punctual services are often late to work or appointments, negatively impacting their performance and job satisfaction.
3.	Impact on Passenger Satisfaction: The National Rail Passenger Survey (NRPS) frequently shows dissatisfaction among passengers regarding the punctuality and reliability of train services. For example, a 2023 survey revealed that less than half of passengers were satisfied with how delays were managed and communicated.
4.	Environmental Impact of Reduced Rail Use: Delays often push passengers to seek alternative transport options, such as cars, which contribute to increased carbon emissions. This undermines government goals of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting public transport.
Knock-On Effects of Delays:
1.	Commuter Stress and Productivity Loss: Delays can cause significant stress to commuters, particularly those with rigid schedules. Studies in workplace psychology suggest that consistent travel disruptions reduce overall job satisfaction and mental well-being.
2.	Disruption to Connecting Services: A delayed train can lead to missed connections, which may cause further cascading delays for passengers on other routes.
3.	Economic Consequences: Inconsistent train services can deter businesses from relying on rail freight or discourage individuals from seeking employment opportunities far from home, ultimately reducing labor mobility.
4.	Impact on Emergency Services: For commuters like doctors, nurses, or emergency responders, delays can have more severe consequences, potentially affecting patient care or emergency response times.
I have chosen to focus on analyzing train journey efficiency and delay patterns in the UK due to a combination of personal experience and a keen interest in transportation systems. As a frequent traveler who relies on UK trains for daily commuting and long-distance journeys, I have personally encountered the inconvenience and frustration caused by unexpected delays and cancellations.
These experiences have sparked my curiosity about the underlying factors contributing to such disruptions. My interest in this subject is further fueled by a passion for data science and its potential to solve real-world problems. I believe that by applying data analytics to the transportation sector, we can uncover valuable insights that lead to tangible improvements in service reliability and passenger satisfaction.
Causes of the Problem:
1.	Aging Infrastructure:
Many parts of the UK’s rail infrastructure date back to the 19th century. As highlighted by the National Infrastructure Commission, outdated track systems, signal failures, and inadequate maintenance contribute significantly to train delays. Modernization projects often lag behind, exacerbating reliability issues.
2.	Overcrowding and Capacity Issues:
The UK rail network is one of the busiest in Europe, with over 1.7 billion annual passenger journeys pre-pandemic (source). High passenger numbers during peak hours strain the system, making it prone to bottlenecks and operational delays.
3.	Weather and Environmental Factors:
Adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, and extreme heat, frequently disrupt train services. Network Rail reported that weather-related incidents accounted for 20% of delays in 2023 (source).
4.	Staff Shortages and Strikes:
A lack of adequately trained staff and frequent industrial actions disrupt the schedule and reduce service reliability. For example, the Rail, Maritime, and Transport (RMT) union strikes in 2023 caused widespread cancellations (source).
5.	Technological Failures:
Outdated technology in signaling systems leads to delays. The slow rollout of the European Train Control System (ETCS), intended to replace traditional signaling, has caused further disruptions (source).
6.	Timetable Issues:
Unrealistic scheduling and poorly planned timetables result in cascading delays across the network. For instance, the introduction of new timetables in 2018 caused widespread disruption due to insufficient testing (source).

Solving the problem of train delays and disruptions can yield significant benefits for both railway companies and passengers. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors affecting train punctuality and reliability, which could lead to improved service quality and customer satisfaction.
Understanding patterns in delays and disruptions could help train operators identify recurring issues, such as equipment malfunctions, scheduling conflicts, or high-traffic periods. By targeting these areas, operators could optimize scheduling, allocate resources more effectively, and address frequent pain points to reduce delays.
Better Risk Management and Future Planning
Analyzing delay patterns across seasons, locations, and other variables can inform long-term strategies. For instance, if certain routes or times of year are associated with higher delays, companies can use these insights for future planning, infrastructure improvements, or seasonal resource adjustments.
•	Questions to Answer: Do delays tend to increase during specific seasons or weather conditions? Are there routes or stations with a persistent record of delays that might require infrastructure updates?
•	Expected Insights: Recognizing seasonal trends and high-risk routes helps in designing better contingency plans, reinforcing areas in need, and reducing the impact of environmental factors on service reliability.
To effectively address the problem of train delays and service disruptions, we can explore several approaches for analyzing the dataset.

Temporal Analysis (Time-Based Patterns and Trends)
Examining the dataset based on time factors—such as specific days, weeks, or seasonal trends—can reveal patterns that impact delays. By comparing delay frequency across various timeframes, we can identify high-risk periods and better understand when delays are most likely to occur.
•	Approach: Analyze delay rates across different times of day (e.g., peak vs. off-peak hours), days of the week, and seasons (e.g., winter vs. summer). Track monthly or seasonal trends in delay causes (e.g., weather-related delays in winter).
•	Expected Insights: This can identify peak times when delays are most likely to occur, allowing operators to allocate more resources or adjust schedules during these periods. It can also reveal if certain times consistently suffer delays, potentially justifying infrastructure improvements.
Predictive Modeling (Forecasting Delays and Preventive Measures)
Developing a predictive model using machine learning could help forecast potential delays and support proactive resource allocation. By using historical data, we can create a model to predict when and where delays are most likely, allowing train operators to take preemptive actions.
•	Approach: Train a predictive model using variables such as time of day, season, route, and cause of delay to estimate delay probabilities. Use historical data to “teach” the model patterns in delay likelihood.
•	Expected Insights: Predictive modeling can serve as an early warning system, enabling operators to prepare resources and make real-time adjustments to reduce delay impacts. This approach provides data-backed guidance for daily operations, potentially reducing the frequency and duration of delays.
Most Appropriate Approach: Combined Temporal, Spatial, and Cause-Based Analysis
After evaluating the different approaches, the combined temporal, spatial, and cause-based analysis stands out as the most appropriate for addressing the goals of this project. This approach aligns well with our requirement to gain a comprehensive understanding of delay patterns and their causes, which will provide actionable insights for operational improvements.
Why This Approach is Best for the Requirements
1.	Comprehensive Insight: This approach allows for a detailed view of when (temporal), where (spatial), and why (cause-based) delays occur, giving us a multi-dimensional understanding of the problem. Addressing train delays requires a holistic view, as focusing solely on one dimension—such as time or location—would miss key interactions between factors.
2.	Practical Actionability: By identifying specific times, locations, and causes associated with delays, this approach enables precise recommendations. For example, if we find that delays are most frequent on specific routes during peak hours due to equipment failure, maintenance scheduling could be adjusted accordingly.
3.	Scalability and Adaptability: This approach is suitable for building a foundation for future predictive modeling, which could be useful for real-time delay predictions and preemptive actions. Once we establish patterns, we can expand this approach to include machine learning for more proactive decision-making.

After analyzing collected data about UK railways in my datasets, I implemented some filtering techniques and cleaned them. I worked with the main dataset, which is called railway_db.xls. Before I extracted the data from it and created other relevant datasets I did some data cleaning.
•	In the column Time of Purchase and Departure time, Arrival time and ctual arrival time I removed millisecond, left (HH:MM: SS),and added PM, or AM
•	In the column “Reason for delay,” I removed empty lines with no delays.
•	In the column “Price”, I changed the data type and added the currency symbol.
•	In the column “Date of Purchase” and “Date of Jurney” I set the type as data.
•	All are sorted by “Date of Purchase”. Other columns were unchanged.
I have calculated and displayed the summary metrics for UK railway dataset, providing insights into:
•	Total delays and cancelations.
•	The percentage of delays and cancelations due to specific reasons.
•	Average delay time, minutes.
•	Average ticket price (delay/cancel).
•	Total refund requests.
•	Percentage of refund requests.
•	Total revenue (delay/cancel).

1. Changes from the Original Plan
The project evolved in a few ways during execution:
•	Focus Areas:
Initially, the plan emphasized a broad analysis of train ticket sales, delays, and cancellations. However, during the Development Stage, the focus shifted more specifically to:
•	The financial impact of delays and cancellations.Refund requests and customer dissatisfaction metrics.Causes of delays, particularly weather and operational factors.
This refinement allowed for deeper insights into the most critical areas, but some secondary aspects, like passenger demographics or specific station-level data, were not explored.
•	Additional Analysis:
While the original plan included investigating the revenue impact and reasons for delays, the analysis of ticket price disparities and the categorization of delay causes were added later to address emerging insights.
A few unexpected findings emerged during the analysis:
•	Higher Ticket Prices for Delayed and Canceled Journeys:
The average ticket price for these journeys (£55.33) was significantly higher than the overall average (£23.44). This suggests that premium services and longer journeys are disproportionately affected, which was not anticipated in the initial plan.
•	High Proportion of Weather-Related Delays:
Weather was responsible for 40.45% of delays, highlighting the vulnerability of the system to environmental factors. This discovery pointed to the need for infrastructure improvements and better weather forecasting integration.
•	Significant Refund Requests:
Around 23.8% of delayed or canceled journeys resulted in refund requests. This was higher than expected and underscored the financial and operational strain caused by delays. But almost 74% did not request a refund, which means that the company just kept that money.
3. Investigation Scope
While most of the objectives within the original plan were met, some areas remained unexplored due to time, data, or resource limitations:
•	Passenger Demographics:
Insights into which passenger groups (e.g., commuters vs. tourists) are most affected were not analyzed due to a lack of demographic data.
•	Regional Variations:
The analysis did not include a detailed breakdown of delays and cancellations by region or specific train routes, which could have provided more localized insights.
